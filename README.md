# lin_PM_GUI
Power Meter GUI

Used for communicating with USB Power meters to help take readings without taking up too much of the PCs resources.
An updated version of a Visual Basic for Applications script, which hung excel meaning that data couldn't be stored etc.


Uses multithreading to take readings continually, while also updating the GUI.

Designed to work with specific model of USB power meters only. 

NOTE: I did not choose the GUI colour scheme.
NOTE: pyinstaller setup.py not included as it would expose filepaths
